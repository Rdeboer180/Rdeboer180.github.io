          <>
            <p>Because I\u2019ve been here since the beginning. I\u2019ve followed the podcast since 2018 and joined NerdHerd on day one. Garrett, Rich, and Matt have been a consistent part of my week for years\u2014a genuine escape from daily stressors and one of the communities I actually look forward to being part of. That kind of loyalty isn\u2019t manufactured.</p>
            <p>I want to shift my craft toward an organization I\u2019m already passionate about elevating. DynastyNerds has built real trust with a real audience. I want to help make the product experience as strong as the content behind it.</p>

        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you approach design systems at scale?',
        answer: 'I treat design systems like infrastructure, not decoration. At Tire Rack, I built component libraries and token systems in Figma that powered production UI across multiple retail brands. I documented patterns, governed usage, and worked hand-in-hand with engineering to ensure what we designed was what shipped. I\u2019d bring that same rigor to DynastyNerds\u2014building the kind of scalable foundation that lets the product grow alongside the community.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you code or just design?',
        answer: 'Both. I write production front-end code (HTML, SCSS/CSS) and have deep experience with CMS component development. At Tire Rack, I owned the AEM template layer end-to-end\u2014building and maintaining component templates, writing the styles that powered them, and documenting patterns so the broader team could ship consistently. That technical fluency means I can speak engineering\u2019s language and design solutions that are buildable from the start.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can you design for a growing, community-driven product?',
        answer: 'That\u2019s exactly the kind of work I\u2019m drawn to. Community-driven products live or die on trust\u2014and trust is built through consistency, clarity, and an experience that respects the user\u2019s time. I\u2019ve spent my career designing scalable UI systems that hold up as products grow. I understand the constraints of a fast-moving team and know how to prioritize what actually moves the needle.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle mentorship and collaboration?',
        answer: 'Collaboration and mentorship aren\u2019t side quests for me\u2014they\u2019re core to how I work. I\u2019ve led ideation sessions, provided feedback to designers at all levels, and built documentation that helps teams ship consistently without bottlenecking through me. My reviews consistently highlight my ability to build cross-functional relationships and create community across design, UX, analytics, and engineering teams.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What drives you outside of design?',
        answer: (
          <>
            <p>People first. I married my high school sweetheart Stephanie&mdash;we&rsquo;ve now spent more than half our lives together&mdash;and our two kids are the center of everything. Weekends usually mean the park, the zoo, or wherever the next national park road trip takes us.</p>
            <p>Outside of family, a lot of what I do for fun still involves building things. I manage my Type 1 diabetes using a custom-coded branch of the Loop app&mdash;a closed-loop insulin delivery system I\u2019ve configured and maintained myself. It\u2019s equal parts health management and engineering hobby.</p>
            <p>And of course, football Sundays are sacred. The Grandville Gremlins dynasty league keeps a tight group of high school and college friends connected year-round\u2014from draft day through the championship, March Madness brackets, and our family\u2019s annual Pigskin Pick\u2019em. I designed every team\u2019s logo and put the Gremlins brand on everything from coffee mugs to onesies. DynastyNerds has been the soundtrack to all of it since 2018. That\u2019s why I want to help build it.</p>
