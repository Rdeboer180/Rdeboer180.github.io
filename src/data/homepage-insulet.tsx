          <>
            <p>Because I&rsquo;ve been an Omnipod user for over a decade. Insulet&rsquo;s mission isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;m learning from a job description\u2014it&rsquo;s something I live every day. Managing Type 1 Diabetes for 20+ years has given me a firsthand understanding of what it means when a medical brand builds digital experiences that work, and when they don&rsquo;t.</p>
            <p>I want to bring my technical and creative skills to a brand I genuinely believe in. The Associate Manager, HCP Digital Marketing role sits exactly at the intersection of execution, collaboration, and healthcare communication\u2014and that&rsquo;s where I do my best work.</p>

        question: 'Your background is in design. Is this a pivot?',
        answer: (
          <>
            <p>Partially\u2014but less of a leap than it might appear. My day-to-day has always included digital marketing execution: building components in AEM, shipping content updates, coordinating with marketing teams, managing web channel accuracy. The design layer is what I&rsquo;m known for, but the operational and technical execution has always been part of the work.</p>
            <p>What I&rsquo;m shifting is the emphasis\u2014from design-led to execution-led. I&rsquo;m motivated to do that because of the company, the mission, and the fit of the role.</p>

      {
        question: 'Have you worked in regulated industries?',
        answer: 'Yes. At Tire Rack, I operated inside structured approval workflows, brand compliance standards, and multi-stakeholder review processes. I understand the discipline required to ship digital content when accuracy, brand consistency, and compliance are non-negotiable. Healthcare adds additional rigor\u2014and that\u2019s something I take seriously, especially given my personal stake in the space.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What\u2019s your experience with email marketing platforms?',
        answer: 'My deepest experience is in HTML email development\u2014building and maintaining templates that render consistently across clients, with dynamic content and reusable structure. I\u2019ve worked within CMS and marketing automation environments, though Salesforce Marketing Cloud specifically would be an area of growth for me. I pick up platforms quickly, and I have the foundational skills to ramp fast.',

I default to clear documentation, proactive communication, and keeping alignment visible across functions. I&rsquo;m comfortable as a liaison between strategy, creative, and technical teams\u2014that cross-functional role is where I naturally operate.',

        question: 'What drives you outside of work?',
        answer: (
          <>
            <p>People first. I married my high school sweetheart Stephanie\u2014we&rsquo;ve now spent more than half our lives together\u2014and our two kids are the center of everything. Weekends usually mean the park, the zoo, or wherever the next road trip takes us.</p>
            <p>Outside of family, diabetes management is genuinely one of my deepest personal interests. I maintain a custom-coded branch of the Loop app\u2014an open-source closed-loop insulin delivery system that integrates my Dexcom CGM with my Omnipod. I read medical and metabolic research, follow endocrinology podcasts, and stay close to the science behind the tools I depend on. I\u2019m not just a professional who wants to work in healthcare\u2014I\u2019m a patient who wants to improve it.</p>
