    brief: 'Since 2013, I have owned the full seasonal content strategy for Tire Rack\'s high-traffic landing pages — designing, authoring, and deploying a winterized version of the site each fall that targets cold-weather customers across the homepage, tire pages, delivery pages, research content, and wheel adjustment pages. Over the years this process evolved from manual content updates into a scalable AEM Experience Fragment system capable of swapping 20+ components across the site simultaneously.',
    challenge: 'The core challenge was building a maintainable, scalable system that could serve meaningfully different content to winter-climate customers and southern-states customers without duplicating pages or confusing search engines. Early seasonal updates were manual and time-intensive. As Tire Rack\'s digital footprint grew, the process needed to scale — requiring new fragment types, accessible component variants, Adobe Target audience rules, and close collaboration with the Analytics, Photography, and SEO teams to ensure consistency, searchability, and conversion across every variant. I also needed to document the system clearly enough to onboard and mentor junior designers into the authoring workflow.',

    brief: 'Partnered with Deborah Clements, founder of a 30-year family-owned equestrian academy in Granger, Indiana, to build a complete digital brand from scratch. The strategy centered on capturing Heatherwood\u2019s key demographic \u2014 families with children ages 5\u201315 across the Michiana area \u2014 through SEO-leveraged service pages that double as search entry points, FAQ content structured around the real questions parents ask before enrolling, and a conversion path that routes every visitor to a form submission. Each service page was designed as its own landing page with a contact form sidebar, because analytics showed that families arrive searching for a specific activity \u2014 not the brand name.',
    challenge: 'Heatherwood had operated for decades on word-of-mouth alone. There was no brand system, no web presence, and no way for families to discover or enroll online. The core challenge was three-fold: build a brand identity that captures the warmth of a family environment while competing visually with larger commercial programs; architect a site where each service \u2014 riding lessons, summer camps, boarding, birthday parties, trail rides \u2014 functions as an independent SEO entry point with its own conversion path; and deliver the entire system in a way that a non-technical owner can manage independently, with zero ongoing agency dependency.
