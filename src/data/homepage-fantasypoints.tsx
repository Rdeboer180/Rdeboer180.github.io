        question: 'Why FantasyPoints?',

          <>
            <p>Because I&rsquo;m already a subscriber. I&rsquo;ve been following fantasy football content since college, and John Hansen was one of the first voices I trusted. When FantasyPoints launched, I signed up right away&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve stayed.</p>
            <p>I want to design for a product I genuinely believe in. FantasyPoints has the content depth and credibility&mdash;I want to help make the product experience match that standard.</p>
          </>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you approach design systems at scale?',
        answer: 'I treat design systems like infrastructure, not decoration. At Tire Rack, I built component libraries and token systems in Figma that powered production UI across multiple retail brands. I documented patterns, governed usage, and worked hand-in-hand with engineering to ensure what we designed was what shipped. I\u2019d bring that same rigor to FantasyPoints.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you code or just design?',
        answer: 'Both. I write production front-end code (HTML, SCSS/CSS) and have deep experience with CMS component development. At Tire Rack, I owned the AEM template layer end-to-end\u2014building and maintaining component templates, writing the styles that powered them, and documenting patterns so the broader team could ship consistently. That technical fluency means I can speak engineering\u2019s language and design solutions that are buildable from the start.',
      },
      {
        question: 'You don\u2019t have a backend background\u2014is that a problem?',
        answer: 'Not for the work I\u2019d be doing. My strength is on the product and UI side\u2014designing how data is surfaced and experienced, not how it\u2019s stored or piped. That said, I\u2019ve spent years collaborating closely with backend engineers, helping define data structures and API contracts from the front-end perspective. I know how to ask the right questions and design within real technical constraints.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle mentorship and collaboration?',
        answer: 'Collaboration and mentorship aren\u2019t side quests for me\u2014they\u2019re core to how I work. I\u2019ve led ideation sessions, provided feedback to designers at all levels, and built documentation that helps teams ship consistently without bottlenecking through me. My reviews consistently highlight my ability to build cross-functional relationships across design, UX, analytics, and engineering teams.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What drives you outside of design?',
        answer: (
          <>
            <p>People first. I married my high school sweetheart Stephanie&mdash;we&rsquo;ve now spent more than half our lives together&mdash;and our two kids are the center of everything. Weekends usually mean the park, the zoo, or wherever the next national park road trip takes us.</p>
            <p>Outside of family, a lot of what I do for fun still involves building things. I manage my Type 1 diabetes using a custom-coded branch of the Loop app&mdash;a closed-loop insulin delivery system I&rsquo;ve configured and maintained myself. It&rsquo;s equal parts health management and engineering hobby.</p>
            <p>And of course, football Sundays are sacred. I run a dynasty fantasy football league that keeps a tight group of high school and college friends connected year-round. I&rsquo;m a FantasyPoints subscriber, a March Madness bracket obsessive, and the guy running my family&rsquo;s annual Pigskin Pick&rsquo;em. Sports content platforms aren&rsquo;t just something I use&mdash;they&rsquo;re part of how I stay connected to the people I care about.</p>
