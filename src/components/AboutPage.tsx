    question: "What's your background in design and development?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>I'm a Front-End Developer and UX Engineer with 16+ years of professional experience — and a design obsession that started well before that. I built my foundation intentionally: focused every high school elective on visual communication, interned at a local broadcast station, took early college courses while still in high school, and entered <strong>Kendall College of Art and Design's</strong> advanced track, where I majored in Graphic Design and minored in Web Animation.</p>
        <p>Summers in college meant real client work — Notre Dame, the South Bend Tribune, a fitness startup — before moving into product design full-time. That path led to 10+ years at <strong>Tire Rack</strong>, where my role grew well beyond design into UX strategy, design systems, A/B testing, and hands-on front-end development.</p>
      </>

    question: "How are you working with AI — and why are you more prepared for it than most?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>I was an early adopter of AI-augmented design and development workflows. Right now that means getting the most out of tools like <strong>Claude</strong>, <strong>Figma Make</strong>, and AI-assisted code generation — not as a replacement for skill, but as a multiplier for speed and consistency.</p>
        <p>The real value isn't in prompting. It's in <strong>knowing how to build the guardrails before you start</strong>, review what comes out, and refine it against brand standards, accessibility guidelines, and the actual framework your site runs on. Most designers can't do that. I can — because I understand both sides of the handoff.</p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What actually sets you apart as a hire?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>I came in fresh out of college into a design role that leaned on my strengths but quickly exposed the gaps. Conversations around HTML tables, CSS variables, and flexbox felt like a different language. I wasn't at the level of the people around me yet.</p>
        <p>So I closed that gap the only way I knew how — <strong>by putting in the reps</strong>. Conferences, certifications, side projects, asking questions (and then asking more), and constantly refining. That process built something most designers don't have: the instinct to recognize when something is off, and the technical depth to actually fix it.</p>
        <p>I'm as comfortable in the codebase as I am in the design file. I build design systems from the ground up, ship production-quality SCSS/BEM, and work directly with React developers to deliver scalable, token-based component libraries.</p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "How do you work — process, communication, remote vs. in-person?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>I'm methodical but not rigid. Every project starts with <strong>understanding the real problem</strong> — stakeholder interviews, business goals, user research — before a single pixel moves. I document decisions so engineers can build confidently and teams can extend the work without me in the room.</p>
        <p>Communication-wise, I default to transparency. I'd rather surface a risk early than deliver a surprise late. I thrive in cross-functional teams where design, engineering, and product are in the same conversation — whether that's in-person or async over Figma comments and Slack threads.</p>
        <p>I've worked effectively in both remote and hybrid environments for years. The rhythm matters more than the location.</p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Who are you outside of design?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>I'm a dad, a husband, and someone who takes his craft seriously without taking himself too seriously. When I'm not designing or writing code, I'm probably working on a side project, watching game film on design trends, or coaching my kids' sports teams.</p>
        <p>I treat my career the way an athlete treats performance — <strong>deliberately</strong>. That means ongoing learning, refining how I communicate, and staying curious about what's next. The same intensity I bring to a design system, I bring to everything else.</p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What's the project you're most proud of and why?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>The <strong>Tire Rack design system</strong>. Not because it was the flashiest — but because it was the hardest. I built it from the ground up inside a complex AEM architecture serving millions of users, earned buy-in from engineering leads who were skeptical at first, and shipped a scalable token-based system with Figma Token Studio that's still in production.</p>
        <p>It proved that a designer who understands code can close the gap between "what we designed" and "what actually shipped" — and that's the kind of impact I want to keep having.</p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "What does your ideal team or role look like?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>I do my best work on teams that value <strong>craft, clarity, and ownership</strong>. I want to be in the room where decisions are made — not just handed a ticket. I'm looking for a role where I can bridge design and engineering, contribute to systems-level thinking, and help a team ship work that actually holds up in production.</p>
        <p>Ideally, that's a senior or lead IC role on a product team that's building something real — not just shipping pixels, but solving problems that matter to the business and the user.</p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "How do you handle feedback and critique?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Directly. I learned early that the best designers are the ones who <strong>seek critique, not avoid it</strong>. If something isn't working, I want to know — and I want to know why, so I can fix the root cause and not just the symptom.</p>
        <p>I also give feedback the same way: honest, specific, and framed around the goal — never personal. Good critique makes the work better. I actively build that culture on every team I join.</p>

            I'm a designer and developer who leads with family first — my wife Stephanie, my two kids, and my playful loving Golden Retriever — and the belief that the best work comes from people who have a full life outside of it. I've spent 16+ years building at the intersection of design and engineering, and I'm looking for a company that sees work-life balance not as a perk but as a foundation for the kind of focused, high-quality output I take pride in delivering.

          <p className="about-page__hero-body">
            Beautiful design has always come from the willingness to make mistakes and learn from them fast. What excites me about where AI is taking this space is that the cost of that mistake just collapsed. I've always been someone with more ideas than hours in the day — someone who can see what something should be and map out how to get there. AI gives me a low-cost construction crew that can build in a day what used to take months, and it means I'm no longer precious about tearing something down and starting over. Test it, learn, rebuild better. Figma and XD gave us that on a smaller scale years ago with flows and patterns — now we can test fully fleshed out ideas and interactions at a scale that wasn't possible before. That's what doesn't scare me about the AI movement. Because having the vision, knowing how to direct it, and being able to review and refine what comes out — that's exactly what it will take to be an irreplaceable designer over the next five years as this space contracts and evolves.
